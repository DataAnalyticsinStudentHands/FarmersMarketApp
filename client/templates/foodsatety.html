      <h1>Tips for Fresh Produce Safety</h1>
        <h2>Buying Tips</h2>
        <p> <ul>
        <li>Purchase produce that is not bruised or damaged.</li>
        <li>When selecting fresh-cut produce - such as a half a watermelon or bagged salad greens - choose items that are refrigerated or surrounded by ice.</li>
        <li>Bag fresh fruits and vegetables separately from meat, poultry and seafood products.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Storage Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Store perishable fresh fruits and vegetables (like strawberries, lettuce, herbs, and mushrooms) in a clean refrigerator at a temperature of 40Â° F or below.  </li>
    <li>Refrigerate all produce that is purchased pre-cut or peeled.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Preparation Tips</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Begin with clean hands. Wash your hands for 20 seconds with warm water and soap before and after preparing fresh produce.</li>
        <li>Cut away any damaged or bruised areas on fresh fruits and vegetables. Produce that looks rotten should be discarded.</li>
        <li>All produce should be thoroughly washed before eating. Wash fruits and vegetables under running water just before eating, cutting or cooking.</li>
        <li>Many precut, bagged produce items like lettuce are pre-washed. If the package indicates that the contents have been pre-washed, you can use the produce without further washing.</li>
        <li>Even if you plan to peel the produce before eating, it is still important to wash it first.</li>
        <li>Washing fruits and vegetables with soap or detergent or using commercial produce washes is not recommended.</li>
        <li>Scrub firm produce, such as melons and cucumbers, with a clean produce brush.</li>
        <li>Drying produce with a clean cloth towel or paper towel may further reduce bacteria that may be present.</li>
    </ul>
